# debtcollective-theme

This project has been based upon the structure generated by [Discourse Theme CLI](https://meta.discourse.org/t/discourse-theme-cli-console-app-to-help-you-build-themes/82950) to hold all customization needed for the custom debtcollective community _(all customisation that fits within the Theme scope)_.

If you want to know more about themes, themes component, widgets and other customisation approaches for Discourse take a look at [Beginner’s guide to using Discourse Themes](https://meta.discourse.org/t/beginners-guide-to-using-discourse-themes/91966).

## Customization

This theme expect the community to have set **Categories only** as a homepage, you can achieve that by running setup wizard again visiting `http://localhost:3000/wizard` (for local discourse)

### Current Efforts

The current efforts section in the Home Page pulls from the `current-efforts` tag. This tag is only be avaiable for staff to use.

## Development

There are different ways to approach this, using a local setup of Discourse and using the [Theme creator](https://theme-creator.discourse.org/) which doesn't need much further setup for you to start the development process but it does need **internet connection to develop**. Check [Beginners’ guide to using Theme Creator and Theme CLI to start building a Discourse theme](https://meta.discourse.org/t/beginners-guide-to-using-theme-creator-and-theme-cli-to-start-building-a-discourse-theme/108444), after complete you should be ready to start.

Once you are set you should be able to run

```shell
cd /path/to/folder_containing_debtcollective-theme
discourse_theme watch debtcollective-theme
```
